# Feature Planning Log

Track feature planning sessions separately from implementation operations.

**Purpose**: Audit trail for planning decisions, not actual changes.
**Implementation log**: See `LEDGER.md` for actual operations.

## Log Structure

Each entry contains:
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for the planning session
- **Duration**: How long the planning took
- **Request**: What was requested
- **Status**: COMPLETED, BLOCKED, FAILED, DRY_RUN
- **Output**: Where artifacts were created
- **Deferred**: Tasks pushed to GitHub issues
