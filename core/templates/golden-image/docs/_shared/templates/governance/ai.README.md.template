# .ai/ (AI Artifacts) — Template

Copy to: `.ai/README.md`

## Purpose
This directory contains **AI artifacts** and enforces a deterministic artifact lifecycle.

## Rules
- `.ai/_scratch/` is ephemeral and MUST NOT be committed.
- `.ai/ledger/LEDGER.md` is append-only and MUST be updated every AI run.

## Allowed contents
- `ledger/` — run logs (committed)
- `bundles/` — executable planning bundles (committed)
- `inference/` — process rules (committed)
- `_out/` — generated artifacts explicitly approved to keep (committed)
- `_scratch/` — temporary working artifacts (never committed)
